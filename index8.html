  <title>5 food good for our eye</title>
</head>
<body>
  
      <h1> Raw Red Peppers</h1>
    <p>Bell peppers give you the most vitamin C per calorie. 
    That's good for the blood vessels in your eyes, and science suggests it could lower your risk of getting cataracts. 
    It's found in many vegetables and fruits, including bok choy, cauliflower, papayas, and strawberries. 
    Heat will break down vitamin C, so go raw when you can. Brightly colored peppers also pack eye-friendly vitamins A and E.</p>


  <h1>Dark, Leafy Greens</h1>
  <p>Kale, spinach, and collard greens, for example, are rich in both vitamins C and E. 
    They also have the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. 
    These plant-based forms of vitamin A lower your risk of long-term eye diseases, including AMD and cataracts. 
    Most people who eat Western diets don't get enough of them</p>


<h1>Salmon</h1>
<p>Your retinas need two types of omega-3 fatty acids to work right: DHA and EPA. 
    You can find both in fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, as well as other seafood. 
    Omega-3s also seem to protect your eyes from AMD and glaucoma. 
    Low levels of these fatty acids have been linked to dry eyes.</p>

<h1>Sweet Potatoes</h1>
<p>Orange-colored fruits and vegetables  like sweet potatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, mangos, and apricots  are high in beta carotene, a form of vitamin A that helps with night vision, your eyes' ability to adjust to darkness. 
    One sweet potato also has more than half the vitamin C you need in a day and a little vitamin E.</p>
  
    <h1>Lean Meat and Poultry</h1>
  <p>Zinc brings vitamin A from your liver to your retina, where it's used to make the protective pigment melanin. 
    Oysters have more zinc per serving than any other food, but you don't have to be a shellfish lover to get enough: Beef, pork, and chicken (both dark and breast meat) are all good sources.</p>
