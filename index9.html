  <h1> 1. Go darker with your greens.</h1>
<p>Nothing beats calcium for your bones. Sure, you can get it from dairy, but it’s also found in lots of vegetables. Why not do both? One great choice: dark leafy greens such as bok choy, Chinese cabbage, kale, collard greens, and turnip greens. One cup of cooked turnip greens has about 200 milligrams of calcium (20% of your daily goal). On top of that, dark greens also have vitamin K, which can reduce your risk for osteoporosis.</p>



<h1>2. “Milks” from plants.</h1>
<p>You’d think that by swapping out dairy milk for the kind made from soybeans, almonds, or coconuts, you’d lose all that calcium and vitamin D. But most of the varieties you’ll find in the store have been given an extra boost of those nutrients. Check the label to be sure.</p>





<h1>3. Start your day off tart.</h1>


<p>Add a grapefruit to your breakfast and you’ll be doing more than waking up your taste buds. Citrus fruits have vitamin C, which has been shown to help prevent bone loss. One whole pink or red grapefruit has about 88 milligrams of vitamin C, giving you the amount you need for the entire day. Can’t handle the sourness of a grapefruit? A navel orange comes in close with 83 milligrams.</p>


<h1>4. Get figgy with it.
</h1>
<p>If you’re looking for bone-strengthening fruits, figs should be near the top of your shopping list. Five medium fresh figs have around 90 milligrams of calcium and other skeleton-saving nutrients like potassium and magnesium. Fresh figs are grown in California through the summer and fall, but you can find them dried all year. And dried ones are just as good: Half a cup of dried figs have 121 milligrams of calcium</p>



<h1>5. Think beyond canned tuna.</h1>
<p>
Salmon and other types of fatty fish offer an array of bone-boosting nutrients. They contain vitamin D, which helps your body use calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, which may also aid bones. One of the best ways to buy salmon is actually canned. Three ounces has 187 milligrams of calcium. Why such a high amount? Small, soft bones get included with the meat in the canning process (don’t worry, you won’t even notice them).</p>
